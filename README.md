# jerrittpace.com

This is a preloader sample page I want to include on my main splash page at http://jerrittpace.com, but I need help to get the code to pull the assets before running the preloader.  This preloader only uses time as a factor for preload, but I want the preloader to show while the background files are loading, and once they are loaded, then the html is activated.


The ajax code is explained at

I got the file heirarchy straight finally.
